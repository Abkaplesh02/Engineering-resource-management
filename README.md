# Engineering-resource-management


🚀 Step-by-Step Roadmap
🔹 1. Define Scope & Requirements
Core Features:
Engineer Management: Add, edit, remove engineers; track skills, availability.

Project Management: Create, update, assign engineers.

Assignment Tracking: View who's working on what, for how long.

Capacity Planning: See who is under/over-utilized.

Dashboards: Role-based views (Admin, PM, Engineer).

Auth & Roles: Login/Signup with RBAC.

AI Tool Integration:

GitHub Copilot (for generating boilerplate code)

ChatGPT (for logic help, bug fixing, documentation generation)

Optional Enhancements:
Search/filter engineers by skill

Notification system

Calendar view

                            +-> AI Tools Integration
🎯 User Roles
Admin: Manage all data, full access.

Project Manager: Create projects, assign engineers, track capacity.

Engineer: View own tasks and availability.

🔹 3. Tech Stack Recommendation
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React.js + TailwindCSS
Backend	Node.js + Express.js
Database	PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Auth	JWT + Role-based middleware
Dev Tools	GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT
Deployment	Vercel (frontend), Render/Heroku (backend), Railway (DB)

🔹 4. Database Schema Design (ERD)

Copy
Edit
Users
- id
- name
- email
- role (Admin/PM/Engineer)
- password

Engineers
- id
- userId (FK to Users)
- skills (array/text)
- availability (hours/week)

Projects
- id
- name
- startDate
- endDate

Assignments
- id
- engineerId (FK)
- projectId (FK)
- startDate
- endDate
- allocation (in %)

🔹 5. Feature Planning & Pages
Page/Component	Description
Login/Register	Role-based login
Dashboard	Cards, charts for KPIs per role
Engineer List	Table with filters, view/edit/delete
Project List	Add/Edit projects
Assignment Planner	Assign engineers to projects
Capacity View	Utilization charts
Profile	Engineer view of own tasks

🔹 6. AI Tools Usage
Tool	Use Case
GitHub Copilot	Generate boilerplate, backend CRUD logic, UI components
ChatGPT	API design help, troubleshooting, regex building, code reviews
README	Mention where/when/how you used these tools

✅ Development Phases
🛠️ Phase 1 – Setup
Set up GitHub repo, create branches

Set up Node.js backend with Express

Set up PostgreSQL and connect with Sequelize/Prisma

Basic REST APIs for users, engineers, projects

🛠️ Phase 2 – Frontend UI
Create pages using React + Tailwind

Setup routing and auth guards

Start with Admin dashboard

🛠️ Phase 3 – RBAC & Auth
JWT token system

Middleware for route protection

Role-based rendering on frontend

🛠️ Phase 4 – Core Features
Assignment module

Capacity tracking logic

Dashboards with charts (Chart.js or Recharts)

🛠️ Phase 5 – Polish and AI Integration
Use Copilot to refactor duplicate code

Use ChatGPT to help with optimization or documentation

Write about how you used them in README

🧠 How to Think Like a Lead
Modularize everything: Don’t write huge functions or components.

Think of user flow: Login → Dashboard → Manage → Track

Write for change: Code so that future team members can extend easily.

Use Copilot/ChatGPT to speed up, not just rely blindly.
